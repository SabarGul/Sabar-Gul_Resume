README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and explains the purpose of each file.

responsive_resume.html: This is the main HTML file for the responsive version of the resume. It follows a 12-column grid concept, which allows the content to adapt smoothly to different screen sizes. The 12-column grid is widely used in responsive web design to create flexible layouts. This file is intended for viewers accessing the resume on devices of various sizes, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

responsive_styles.css: This CSS file contains the styling rules for responsive_resume.html. It includes media queries and grid layout styles that make use of the 12-column grid system. The responsive styles ensure that the resume layout adjusts to the screen width, providing an optimal user experience on different devices.

styles.css: This file holds general CSS styling for the non-responsive version of the resume (in webpage.html). The styles here are simpler and do not include any grid layout or media queries. It is best suited for static display on a desktop-sized screen, where adaptability to different screen sizes is not necessary.

webpage.html: This file is a basic HTML version of the resume that does not include responsive design. It is meant to be viewed on desktop or larger screens, where responsiveness is not critical. Unlike responsive_resume.html, this file does not use the 12-column grid concept and has a fixed layout.
